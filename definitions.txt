Options are a type of financial derivative, i.e. a contract between a buyer and seller. With options,
investors may speculate on the price of a given security (a tradeable asset) at a later moment in time
known as the expiration date. All options are either call options or put options.

During a call option, a buyer pays a premium to gain the option to buy the underlying security at a
pre-determined price, agreed with the seller. This is known as either the strike price or the exercise
price. If the security's price is above the strike price by the expiration date, the buyer may wish to
exercise their option by purchasing the security. Hence, they now own a stock for the value of the
strike price minus the premium. So if strike price + premium < current security price, they have made
a profit. Alternatively, if the security has decreased in price, then the buyer may choose not to buy
it, as they have no such obligation. This results in them losing the money paid for the premium. Of
course, any money made by the buyer is lost by the seller, and vice versa.

A put option is extremely similar to a call option, save that the buyer gains the right, but not
obligation, to sell the underlying security. This right is given after paying the premium, as with
call options. So buyers of put options make a profit if the security sufficiently decreases below the
the strike price.

With European options, the holder may only exercise their option on the expiration date. American
options instead allow the holder to exercise their option at any point between the purchase date and
the expiration date. As American options give the holder an increased degree of flexibility, they
generally have higher premiums than European options.
